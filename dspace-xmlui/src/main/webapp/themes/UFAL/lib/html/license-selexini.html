  <h3>License Terms</h3>
  <p>The SELEXINI Corpora is a collection of linguistic data. Each of the corpora has its own license terms and you (the “User”) are responsible for complying with the license terms applicable to those parts which you use. If you do not agree with the license terms, you must stop using the corpora and destroy all copies of the data that you have obtained.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The licenses for the annotations (columns 1,3-10) and words are different, which is indicated in the table below. All files in the bin/ and trial/ folders are licensed under CC BY 4.0.</p>
